                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Livingston Manor, a small town on the edge of the Catskill Mountains with just
                over 1,233 residents in 2018 serves as a our case study for this project. Livingston Manor's previous newspaper publication 
                ceased in 2009, a victim of the Great Recession. In 2012, Manor Ink was founded, and is currently run by two adults and five 
                high school students. Today, news and knowledge about the town is captured and recorded only by this grassroots newsroom.</div>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">The origin of the word Palimpsest is used for something reused or altered but 
                still bearing visible traces of its earlier form. It can be used for material documents as well as larger scale
                urban lanscapes. Our project acts as a bridge between the physical and the the digital, lost historical data and community members by
                allowing them to share archival pictures on our platform. </div>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">In order to connect residents together, create relationships within the town community. The 
                project aims to be accessible to the public and serve a greater purpose, using technology to advance the public interest. Through a digital 
                platform, the project hopes to create real relationships and redefine archival purposes for a town.</div>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Our solution, "Palimpsest", introduces a prototype that encourages communities to share their 
                moments and their local history. The act of sharing memories allows for connections to be drawn between community members and creates a sesnse of 
                belonging and unity within the neighborhoood.</div>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">News deserts are communities with limited access to credible and comprehensive news -- are especially prevalent in rural America. 
                    More than 500 of the 1,800 newspapers that have closed or merged since 2004 were in rural communities.
                    <br> 
                    In a report released earlier this year, the Pew Research Center found that<strong>about half of U.S. adults (47%) say the local news they get mostly covers an area other 
                    than where they live.</strong></div><br>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white; font-size:30px; font-style: italic;">LIBRARY X NEWSROOM COLLABORATION</div>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">From our interviews with KCQ, NowCastSA, and Local Lives, we realize that both libraries and new organizations play an important role in 
                providing information to a community. Newsroom often write the first draft of a community's history, while libraries preserve its access.</div>
                <img src="images/logos.png" alt="" style="padding-left: 180px;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 60%; height: 60%">

                    poll found that most Americans feel that libraries can help them find reliable, trustworthy information.</div>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Libraries and news organizations tend to have a lot in common — they provide information, they’re a vital community resource — 
                but also because both institutions are in the process of completely reinventing themselves.</div>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Many of the media outlets that remain are under attack for allegedly peddling fake news. It’s a problem that journalists alone cannot fix. 
                Local libraries are pushing to restore people’s faith in the media. </div>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">In some towns, one institution manages both these roles. We collaborated with Manor Ink, a youth-led new organization in Livingston Manor.</div>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Livingston Manor's previous newspapaer publication ceased in 2009, a victim of the Great Recession. In 2012, Manor Ink was founded and is currently

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Through our interview process, we’ve had the chance to talk to and learn from many newsroom x library collaborations, including the Kansas City Star 
                about their “What’s your KCQ?” project. In this project, reporters and librarians answer reader questions together.</div>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">The aim is to teach community members how to locate and access information using library resources, while also highlighting how reporters uncover 
                information through public records, interviews and other journalistic methods. It infuses transparency and engagement into an impactful collaboration.</div>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Savannah, who is a journalist at Kansas City Star, said that the Kansas City Star and the Kansas City Public Library have a special collection 
                together that inspired the KCQ project: the Missouri Valley Special Collections. The special collection has thousands of digitized photographs and material related to the history of Kansas City, 
                and the community members can interact with them at their convenience.</div>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Our connection with the KCQ has inspired our project and now acts as a precedent for Palimpsest.</div>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Our interviews have led us categorize the archetypes related to our project. We have 9 different types, ranging from community leaders to

                    <div style="margin-left:265px; color:#00C5FF; font-style: italic;">Is there an existing bias in the research? Who is being included or excluded?</div>
                    <div style="margin-left:265px; color:white;">This PIT question has led us to think about the different populations that have limited or no access to information. Small towns that are 
                    underrepresented on the internet, or touristic towns that are overrepresented create an inequality of presence on the web.  This has led us to keep asking ourselves: How do we conduct PIT 
                    research when google's top hits are almost all private interest sponsored results and articles?
