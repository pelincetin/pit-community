                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Livingston Manor, a small town on the edge of the Catskill Mountains with just
                over 1,233 residents in 2018 serves as a our case study for this project. Livingston Manor's previous newspaper publication 
                ceased in 2009, a victim of the Great Recession. In 2012, Manor Ink was founded, and is currently run by two adults and five 
                high school students. Today, news and knowledge about the town is captured and recorded only by this grassroots newsroom.</div>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">The origin of the word Palimpsest is used for something reused or altered but 
                still bearing visible traces of its earlier form. It can be used for material documents as well as larger scale
                urban lanscapes. Our project acts as a bridge between the physical and the the digital, lost historical data and community members by
                allowing them to share archival pictures on our platform. </div>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">In order to connect residents together, create relationships within the town community. The 
                project aims to be accessible to the public and serve a greater purpose, using technology to advance the public interest. Through a digital 
                platform, the project hopes to create real relationships and redefine archival purposes for a town.</div>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Our solution, "Palimpsest", introduces a prototype that encourages communities to share their 
                moments and their local history. The act of sharing memories allows for connections to be drawn between community members and creates a sesnse of 
                belonging and unity within the neighborhoood. <br> Their responsibility to capture and preserve community knowledge, prompts our question: </div>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:300px; color:lightskyblue; font-size:25px; font-style: italic;">How might we help Livingston Manor record and engage with their shared 
                history so that communityy members have a greater sense of identity, belonging, and unity?</div>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:300px; color:white; font-size:15px; font-style: italic;">"A civic gap definitely exists. If there was a resource for community news, I 
                    think that people are starving for it."</div>

                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">News deserts are communities with limited access to credible and comprehensive news -- are especially prevalent in rural America. 
                    More than 500 of the 1,800 newspapers that have closed or merged since 2004 were in rural communities.
                    <br> 
                    In a report released earlier this year, the Pew Research Center found that<strong>about half of U.S. adults (47%) say the local news they get mostly covers an area other 
                    than where they live.</strong></div><br>
                <div style="margin-left:350px; color:white; font-size:30px; font-style: italic;">LIBRARY X NEWSROOM COLLABORATION</div>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">From our interviews with KCQ, NowCastSA, and Local Lives, we realize that both libraries and new organizations play an important role in 
                providing information to a community. Newsroom often write the first draft of a community's history, while libraries preserve its access.</div>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">In some towns, one institution manages both these roles. We collaborated with Manor Ink, a youth-led new organization in Livingston Manor.</div>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Livingston Manor's previous newspapaer publication ceased in 2009, a victim of the Great Recession. In 2012, Manor Ink was founded and is currently 
                run by two adults and five high school students. Today, news and knowledge about the twon are captured and recorded only by this grassroots newsroom.</div>

                <br>
                <div style="margin-left:250px; color:white;">Much of our solutions seem to be supported by funding. Amount of funding and budget allocation available is variable between large newspapers and smaller 
                news outlets. Building that trust is another crucial factor which varies, but still exists nevertheless as a relevant problem no matter what the size of the newspaper. We'd like to do more reserach about
                 the community engagement and interest (ie. how the community reacts to various newspaper initiatives and library programs)</div>

                through a third party. We will not know what type of population is scanning the QR codes (younger/older)</div>
